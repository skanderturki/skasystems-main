Biography
Born on August 2, 1980, in Paris, currently living in Riyadh, Nadia Rouatbi is a Tunisian artist whose creative journey bridges continents, 
disciplines, and identities. Though she pursued mechanical engineering at Université Claude Bernard in Lyon,
 her lifelong passion for art never left her. Years later, after building her family, she turned fully toward her 
 artistic calling, immersing herself in rigorous training with both internationally acclaimed and regionally 
 celebrated artists.

Her work is a quiet rebellion: her visual language is deeply introspective, inviting viewers to reflect 
on the unseen boundaries: cultural, emotional, and imagined, that shape how we perceive ourselves and others. 

Alongside her studio work, she remains committed to expanding her technical and conceptual skills through ongoing workshops and continuous learning and practice.
